# moodle-local-charts
Moodle plugin allowing the creation of charts/graphs using [Google Charts](https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/interactive/docs/quick_start).

Additional charts/graphs can be created by implementing a chart subplugin such as [activitiesbreakdown](https://github.com/JonathanBlood/moodle-local-charts/tree/master/charts/charts/activitiesbreakdown).
